General Plan (vision):
1. Play an oxyphenbutazone game.
2. Try to remove moves one-by-one,
  actually remove those which are not required for oxyphenbutazone.
3. Play a new game with these letters at these moments,
  possibly in the bottom part of the board.
4. Try to construct a long word from cheap letters at the bottom,
  perhaps a few letters "s" will be needed.

20140530:
Random Ideas:
1. Check for a flipped version of oxyphenbutazone, too.
  Take care of the bias calculation when flipping.
2. Local improvement:
  Remove one critical move.
  Remove some non-critical moves.
  Do a search, maybe the critical move can be replaced with a better one.

20140604:
Beam Search improvements:
1. Factor away from Game.
2. Add associative array by current Rack:
  one or more bests for each possible Rack.
