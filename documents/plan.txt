20140530:
General Plan (vision):
1. Play an oxyphenbutazone game.
2. Try to remove moves one-by-one,
  actually remove those which are not required for oxyphenbutazone.
3. Play a new game with these letters at these moments,
  possibly in the bottom part of the board.
4. Try to construct a long word from cheap letters at the bottom,
  perhaps a few letters "s" will be needed.
Problem: a good long word play usually requires
  at least 5 of the 7 letters in the rack.
  The remaining space does not allow to build
  the second long word simultaneously.
  So, the forbidden letters overlap must be
  at most two letters.

20140530:
Random Ideas:
1. (+) Check for a flipped version of oxyphenbutazone, too.
  Take care of the bias calculation when flipping.
2. Local improvement:
  (buggy) Remove one critical move.
  Remove some non-critical moves.
  Do a search, maybe the critical move can be replaced with a better one.

20140604:
Beam Search improvements:
1. Factor away from Game.
2. Add associative array by current Rack:
  one or more bests for each possible Rack.

20140608:
Smart goals: (+)
1. (+) Allow only 15-bit masks leading to at least 8 covered cells.
2. (+) Do not add bonus after 8 covered cells.
3. (+) Do not add bonus for double-letter cells.
Result: X: 2528 -> 2627

Words:
1. (+) Try constructing the third 15-letter word
  on the center row in the process.

Random Ideas:
1. If Q is coming soon, try to put it on the current board,
  and give bonus value if possible. 
  The closer the Q, the larger the bonus.

20140614:
Random Ideas:
1. Speedup - One-Letter Goals.
  For each tile or letter (especially unique ones),
  store where it should go.
  This will allow to detect impossible moves quicker,
  when drawing that tile from the rack.

20140618:
Beam Search improvements:
1. Add associative array by currently covered pre-goal line mask.
2. Add associative array by currently covered goal mask.

20140622:
Random Ideas:
1. Have two goals and a lesser goal for letter Q.
2. Fix tile usage bug in removing critical moves.

20140623:
Random Ideas:
1. Have a parallel word of medium length near the long words.
  Search for a suitable word at the beginning.
2. Add the center goal after the two larger goals, not before that.
  Use all 70 letters left for that goal.
  Bear in mind that the center letter must be one of the first seven.
  Allow pieces disconnected from the center in the center goal.
  Maybe try to forbid just the first and the last letter.

Beam Search improvements:
1. Add associative array by sectors:
  areas close to where we have to put letters.
2. Search with bias=0 and three goals.

20140709:
Notes:
1. Give value for each goal letter successfully put.
2. Give value for having an adjacent letter to each pending goal letter?

140709 version OXYPHENBUTAZONE fail reasons:
1. ~6x A free letter Q,V,L,I has no free place. Too crowded.
  Solution: ask for a second word, maybe it won't be crowded then ;) ?
  Solution: ensure that Q is in one of the goals. Add value for that?
2. ~1x Bridged segments 1 and 3, closing opportunities for segment 2.
  Solution: give value for consecutive order of the checkpoints.
3. ~1x Too close but not growable. Alternative route too far and thus no bonus.
  Solution: add value for not one but also the number of closest tiles?
4. ~1x HEN has N, pending H. UTA has U, pending A. Result: out of rack space.
  Solution: give value for consecutive order inside segments? Or split them?
  Solution: give value for each goal letter successfully put.

20140716:
Notes:
1. Try building only three lower or upper lines. Allow dropping a tile.
  Encourage the least possible number of tiles to reach checkpoints.
2. Discourage every position except first and last three rows,
  and also three center columns.
  Discourage having much tiles, too, without getting closer to the goals.
