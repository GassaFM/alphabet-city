General Plan (vision):
1. Play an oxyphenbutazone game.
2. Try to remove moves one-by-one,
  actually remove those which are not required for oxyphenbutazone.
3. Play a new game with these letters at these moments,
  possibly in the bottom part of the board.
4. Try to construct a long word from cheap letters at the bottom,
  perhaps a few letters "s" will be needed.
Problem: a good long word play usually requires
  at least 5 of the 7 letters in the rack.
  The remaining space does not allow to build
  the second long word simultaneously.
  So, the forbidden letters overlap must be
  at most two letters.

20140530:
Random Ideas:
1. (+) Check for a flipped version of oxyphenbutazone, too.
  Take care of the bias calculation when flipping.
2. Local improvement:
  Remove one critical move.
  Remove some non-critical moves.
  Do a search, maybe the critical move can be replaced with a better one.

20140604:
Beam Search improvements:
1. Factor away from Game.
2. Add associative array by current Rack:
  one or more bests for each possible Rack.

20140608:
Smart goals: (+)
1. (+) Allow only 15-bit masks leading to at least 8 covered cells.
2. (+) Do not add bonus after 8 covered cells.
3. (+) Do not add bonus for double-letter cells.
Result: X: 2528 -> 2627

Words:
1. Try constructing the third 15-letter word
  on the center row in the process.

Random Ideas:
1. If Q is coming soon, try to put it on the current board,
  and give bonus value if possible. 
  The closer the Q, the larger the bonus.
