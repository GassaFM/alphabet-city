General Plan (vision):
1. Play an oxyphenbutazone game.
2. Try to remove moves one-by-one,
  actually remove those which are not required for oxyphenbutazone.
3. Play a new game with these letters at these moments,
  possibly in the bottom part of the board.
4. Try to construct a long word from cheap letters at the bottom,
  perhaps a few letters "s" will be needed.
Problem: a good long word play usually requires
  at least 5 of the 7 letters in the rack.
  The remaining space does not allow to build
  the second long word simultaneously.
  So, the forbidden letters overlap must be
  at most two letters.

20140530:
Random Ideas:
1. (+) Check for a flipped version of oxyphenbutazone, too.
  Take care of the bias calculation when flipping.
2. Local improvement:
  (buggy) Remove one critical move.
  Remove some non-critical moves.
  Do a search, maybe the critical move can be replaced with a better one.

20140604:
Beam Search improvements:
1. Factor away from Game.
2. Add associative array by current Rack:
  one or more bests for each possible Rack.

20140608:
Smart goals: (+)
1. (+) Allow only 15-bit masks leading to at least 8 covered cells.
2. (+) Do not add bonus after 8 covered cells.
3. (+) Do not add bonus for double-letter cells.
Result: X: 2528 -> 2627

Words:
1. (+) Try constructing the third 15-letter word
  on the center row in the process.

Random Ideas:
1. If Q is coming soon, try to put it on the current board,
  and give bonus value if possible. 
  The closer the Q, the larger the bonus.

20140614:
Random Ideas:
1. Speedup - One-Letter Goals.
  For each tile or letter (especially unique ones),
  store where it should go.
  This will allow to detect impossible moves quicker,
  when drawing that tile from the rack.

20140618:
Beam Search improvements:
1. Add associative array by currently covered pre-goal line mask.
2. Add associative array by currently covered goal mask.

20140622:
Random Ideas:
1. Have two goals and a lesser goal for letter Q.
2. Fix tile usage bug in removing critical moves.
